                <strong><u>Some History</u></strong>
                <br><br>
                Arch Linux was created by Judd Vinet with the first official release on March 11, 2002. Vinet was inspired by CRUX, another
                minimalist Linux distro, and aimed for a lightweight system focused on simplicity. While being a relative new comer to the Linux
                world, Arch is one of the most popular distributions in the world today. Arch is known for living on the bleeding edge
                of software releases, offering up the latest and greatest software as soon as it's released. This can come at the cost of stability
                and security, and may not be best for new Linux users.

                <strong><u>Using Arch</u></strong>
                <br><br>
                Arch Linux is a rolling release distro, meaning that you install it once and it will update itself forever. 
                This is in contrast to the other distributions mentioned on this website which could take years before getting a new
                version.
                <br><br>
                Arch uses the Pacman package manager, an incredibly powerful tool for managing your software. When you pair Pacman
                with the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/" target="_blank"><u>Arch User Repository (AUR)</u></a>, you have access 
                to just about any software you could ever want. The AUR is a community driven project, allowing users to create packages
                not already in the official Arch repositories. Additionally, using an AUR helper like YAY or PARU makes installing and
                updating your system even easier! For instance, to install a package with YAY, the command would be 
                <strong style="background-color: rebeccapurple;">"yay -S package-name"</strong>. Doing a full system update the only
                commanded needed is simply <strong style="background-color: rebeccapurple;">"yay"</strong>.
                <br><br>
                Arch Linux on it's own is as minimal a Linux experiance as you can get. It comes with no desktop environment or user interface,
                and after installation you are simply greated with a blinking cursor, ready to accept your commands. It is up to the user to
                install all of the extra packages and software they want or need to make it exactly the way they want it. This is not ideal
                for new Linux users and seasoned users alike. This is why in April 2021, the "archinstall" script was released, making it 
                easier to install Arch Linux. This script will walk you through the installation process and even help installing the desktop
                environment of your choice.

                <strong><u>Wrapping Up</u></strong>
                <br><br>
                Arch Linux is a great distro for those seasoned Linux nerds that want to get into the nitty gritty of their system, and have
                complete control over what is installed on their system. It is not for the faint of heart, and I would not recommend it for
                a new Linux user. <strong>HOWEVER...</strong> Arch Linux has some of the best distributions based on it, that are perfect
                for a new Linux user. I have some of these distros listed on the right of the page, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention
                Endeavour OS. It is the distribution that I have been using for the past 5 years, and I can't recommend it enough.

                Endeavour OS is a rolling release distro based on Arch Linux. This is one of the best Arch based Distros
                for those that want to get into the world of Arch without the steep learning curve that comes with vanilla Arch.
                This is the Distro that I primarily use and I can't recommend it enough.

                Garuda Linux is a rolling release distro based on Arch Linux. This distro is another great option to get into 
                the world of Arch without loosing the love of your family and close friends. This distro is also very gaming focused,
                and it's user experiance is top notch.

                Manjaro is a rolling release distro based on Arch Linux. This distro is one of the most popular distros based on Arch.
                It focuses on user friendliness and a very eye pleasing aesthetic. Another great option for those "I run Arch btw" people, 
                without actually having to run Arch.
