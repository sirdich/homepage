                <strong><u>Some History</u></strong>
                <br><br>
                Red Hat Linux was created by Marc Ewing in 1993, and was called "Red Hat" because of his love of wearing his Grandfathers red Cornell lacrosse cap.
                In 1994 Bob Young was selling CDs of Red Hat Linux, and continued to sell out so many times, that he joined forces with Ewing 
                to create Red Hat Software in 1995. Fast forward a few years and in 2001 Red Hat discontinued the Red Hat Linux line, and replaced
                it with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), which opperates on a subscription model, primarily targeting Linux users in the enterprise world.
                This makes Red Hat one of the only Linux Distributions that you have to pay for, but it is also one of the most secure and stable distros.
              </p>
              <p class="home">
                <strong><u>Using Redhat</u></strong>
                <br><br>
                Red Hat Linux comes with the GNOME desktop environment, but just like most Linux distros, you install whatever user experiance you want. 
                However, I think that you'll find most Red Hat Linux installs are operated from a purely command line interface. You may be supprised to 
                know that most Red Hat installs will never see a monitor hooked up to it, as Red Hat is most commonly used in server environments. It is
                also not inconceivable that you have used Red Hat Linux without even knowing it, as it could be serving up this very website you are 
                viewing right now.
                <br><br>
                As Red Hat is an enterprise Linux system, it needs to be incredibly secure and stable. This is why Red Hat has a team of developers that ensure
                Red Hat complies with industry standards and regulations, and nessecitates the subscription model that comes with it. Red Hat
                is not intended for home users, but has distributions based on it that are free to use like 
                <a href="https://rockylinux.org/" target="_blank"><u>Rocky Linux</u></a>.

                <strong><u>Wrapping Up</u></strong>
                <br><br>
                While Red Hat is an incredibly powerful Linux distro, it is not neccecarily intended for home use. It's subscription model and focus on security
                and stability however make it a great choice for enterprise environments. If you are looking to get into the world of Linux from a distro related
                to Red Hat, I'd like to recommend Fedora. Fedora is a great distro for home users, developers and gamers alike. Bazzite is another great disto
                for gamers, and is based on Fedora. If you still feel you need to experiance Red Hat, you can always try out Rocky Linux, which is completely 
                free.

                Fedora is a Linux distro based on Red Hat. It is known for it's cutting edge software and it's focus 
                on free and open source software. Fedora is a great distro for those that want to get a taste of 
                Red Hat without the paying to use a otherwise free operating system. Fedora is also a great distro for developers and those 
                that want to get into the world of Linux development.

                Rocky Linux is a Linux distro based on Red Hat. Just like Red Hat, it is incredibly stable and secure. Rocky Linux is ment
                to be a free alternative to Red Hat, and it is likely running on many home server environmentss across the world.

                Bazzite is a  gaming focused distro that is based on Fedora. Bazzite is a great distro for those
