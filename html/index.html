                Are you tired of your operating system spying on you, serving you ads, and becoming more unstable for the privilege?
                Have you heard of this new fangled operating system called <strong>Linux</strong>? Are you ready to free yourself
                from the shackles of corporate greed and take control of your computer? Then you've come to the right place!
                <br><br>
                Welcome to the world of the superior operating system of <strong>Linux!</strong> Your future is looking bright, and I
                can tell you are very good looking through the screen. Your work is not over yet, you know must chose what distribution
                of Linux you will use. What's that? There are hundreds of different distributions to choose from? Fear not, you have
                come to the right place. I will attempt to give you a basic background on the most popular versions of Linux, and some
                of the popular distributions based on them.

                Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,
                an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Because Linux is known as
                a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), it is possible for anyone to read and modify the source code. It also 
                means that it's complete free to use and distribute, giving you back your computer, free from spying eyes and forced
                obsilescence. Because of this, there are hundreds of different distributions, or "distros" to choose from. 3 of
                those distros are considered the "big three" and are the basis for many other distros. Those distros are Debian, Arch
                and Redhat.
                <br><br>
                You can of course choose one of the big three on it's own, and still have the freedom to add all the bells
                and whistles of other distributions, but that comes at the cost of a relatively steep learning curve and your time.
                This website will give you a brief overview of the big three, and highlight some of the more popular distros based on
                them. In the table below, you can see the distos I'll be covering on this website, and which ones they are based on.
